# GESUND AI ðŸ‘‹
## A CRO platform for clinical-grade AI
## Train. Validate. Secure clearance.

Gesund.ai orchestrates the AI as-a-Medical Device lifecycle, providing privacy-centered access to diverse yet standardized medical data sources, and a unique analytical toolbox that fosters clinical validation, regulatory clearance and effective marketing

### How it works
Standardized, unified and diversified data customized for your ML needs and regulatory requirements
Gesund assesses model validation needs and provides a suitable mix of high-quality data from its multiple and diverse clinical partner sites

1. Model owner shares clinical study with Gesund for curation of appropriate dataset(s), and uploads their model onto Gesunds federated validation platform, which resides on hospital premise or private cloud.
2. Model runs against a previously unseen validation data set that has been curated on the hospital side.
3. Model accuracy metrics are produced and displayed on the Gesund platform for further examination with respect to patient characteristics, scenario analyses and stress testing.
4. The model insights are exported into a report for the model owner to supplement their regulatory submission.
